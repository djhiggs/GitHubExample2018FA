                 * Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… 
                 * He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. 
                 * The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. 
                 * He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. 
                 * Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. 
                 * He could save others from death, but not himself.
